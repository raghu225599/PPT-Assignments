Q1>What are the Conditional Operators in Java?

 The && and || Open. operators perform AND two and Conditional - OR operations on two boolean expressions. These operators exhibit ‘Short Circuiting’ behavior, which the Second Operard evaluated only if needed. 
Program Example:
	Class ConditionalDemo{
		Public static void main(String[] args){
			int value1=1;
			int value2=2;
			if((value1==1) && (value2==1))
				System.out.println(“value1 is 1 AND value2 is 2”);
			if((value1==1) || (value2==1))
				System.out.println(“value1 is 1 OR value2 is 1”);
           

		}
	}
