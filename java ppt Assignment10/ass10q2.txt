Q2.What are the benefits of Spring MVC framework over other MVC frameworks?
The Spring MVC framework offers several benefits over other MVC frameworks, which contribute to its popularity among Java developers. Here are some of the key advantages of using Spring MVC:

1)Mature and well-established: The Spring MVC framework has been around for a long time and has gained widespread adoption in the Java community. It has a large and active user base, extensive documentation, and a wealth of resources, making it easier for developers to find support and solutions to their problems.

2)Flexibility and extensibility: Spring MVC offers great flexibility in terms of configuration options and customization. Developers can choose between XML-based or annotation-based configuration, and the framework provides a wide range of extension points to customize the behavior and integrate with third-party libraries. This flexibility enables developers to tailor the framework to suit their specific requirements.

3)Loose coupling and modularity: Spring MVC promotes loose coupling and follows the principle of inversion of control (IoC), making it easy to manage dependencies and write modular code. This allows developers to focus on specific components without being tightly coupled to the framework itself, resulting in code that is more maintainable, testable, and reusable.

4)Community support and active development: Spring MVC benefits from a large and vibrant community of developers. The community actively contributes to the framework's development, releases regular updates and bug fixes, and provides support through forums, documentation, and tutorials. The strong community support ensures that the framework stays up-to-date, secure, and relevant in the rapidly evolving Java ecosystem.
