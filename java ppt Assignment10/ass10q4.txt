Q4.What is a View Resolver pattern and explain its significance in Spring MVC?
The View Resolver pattern in Spring MVC abstracts the process of converting a logical view name to the actual view implementation. It allows developers to work with logical view names that are independent of the rendering technology used. This pattern is significant as it provides flexibility, configurability, and integration with multiple view technologies. It simplifies the development process, allows for customization and fallback mechanisms, and enables easy switching between different view technologies.
