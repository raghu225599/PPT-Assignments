Q9.What does REST stand for? and what is RESTful web services?
REST stands for Representational State Transfer, an architectural style for designing networked applications. RESTful web services adhere to REST principles and use HTTP as the main communication protocol. They enable clients to interact with server-side resources by making requests to specific URLs (endpoints) and receiving responses in a standardized format like JSON or XML. RESTful web services are simple, scalable, stateless, and leverage standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for operations on resources. They are widely used for building modern web and mobile applications due to their scalability, loose coupling, and ability to leverage existing HTTP infrastructure.
