Q7.Explain the types of variables in Java?
varibles are divided based on two phases
	a.based on the type of value the variable holds
		1.primitive type variable: it holds the direct literal
		2.reference type variable: holds the address of an object
	b.based on the position of declaration of a variable
		1.local variable:
			the variables which are declared inside method are known as local variables.
			local variables have to be initialized, for these variables default value will be not given by jvm.
			local variables are stored in stack and if the value is primitive it is stored in stack if it is an object the 
			value is stored in heap memory and the reference(local variable) will point to object present heap memory
			memory for local variable will be allocated once the control enter inside the method.
			memory for local variable will be dealloacated once the control leaves the method.
		2.instance variable:
			if the value of the varible changes from object to object then that variable will be called as instance variable.
			instance variables along with its value, the value can be primitive or object they are stored in heap memory
			the memory for instance variable will be given during the creation of the object.
			the memory for instance variable will be deallocated once the object is destroyed. are stored in heap memory
		3.static variable:
			if the value of the variable will be same for all the instances of the class then that variable will called as
			static variable
			the memory for the static variable will be given at time loading the .class file and memory will be deallocated 
			at the time of unloading the .class file
			static variables and its value if the value is primitive stored at method area, suppose if the value is a  object then it is
			stored at heap at heap area and reference(static variable) will be to the object stored in heap area
