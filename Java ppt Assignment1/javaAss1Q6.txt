Q6>what is a compiler in java?
In Java, a compiler is a software which converts source code which is in high level language into byte code which is neither in high level language nor in machine level language and it is a platform independent representation of the program.
The bytecode is given to jvm for execution.
compiler scans the code only once and identify all the errors present in the code.
