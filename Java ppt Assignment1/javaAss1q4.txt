4)What is JIT Compiler?
 
JIT Stands for just-in-time compiler,when a java program is compiled,it is first convrted into bytecode.During execution the jvm interpretes the bytecode line by line which increases the execution time,so this where JIT compiler comes into play.

The JIT Compiler is a part of jvm which identifies the sections of code that are frequently executed convert them into native code which can 
directly run on hardware so it decreases the execution time which increases the performance.

it doesnot convert entire program which focuses on sections of code that are frequently executed, 
known as hotspots, it compiles them into native code which can be directly executed on hardware
