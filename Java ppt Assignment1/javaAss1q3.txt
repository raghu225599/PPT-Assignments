stack Area: stack area is used for storing local variables and reference variables and these variables should be associate to a method when method call pushed on to stack and when the method completes its task it will popped out of the stack

program counter:program counter is used to store the next instructions to be executed

Method area:In method area .class files will get loaded along with static variables and compile time constants,when .class file loaded on to the method area then static variables are initialized

native method area:native method area is a region of memory within the java virtual machine which is dedicated to store native method code.native methods are implemented in languages other than java,such as c or c++.
